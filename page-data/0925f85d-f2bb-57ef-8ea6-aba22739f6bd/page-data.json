For over 35 years, accusations of murder shrouded one of the art world’s most storied couples. They were a textbook case of opposites attract. Andre was famous, rich, white, and within the small coterie of the artworld, powerful. Mendieta was a Cuban refugee, a diminutive woman, working at the edge of the Avant Garde. Just months after their wedding, Andre called 911 saying they had a fight and Mendieta “went out the window” of their 34th floor apartment. Andre was charged with murder and the art world split in two. Host Helen Molesworth revisits Mendieta’s death and the trial that followed, and interrogates both the silence and the protest that have accompanied this story ever since. A co-production between Pushkin Industries and Somethin’ Else, a Sony Music Entertainment company.","recommender":"Meiga","link":"https://www.pushkin.fm/podcasts/death-of-an-artist","image":{"relativePath":"death_artist.webp","childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRgoBAABXRUJQVlA4IP4AAADQBQCdASoUABQAPtFgqE+oJSOiKAgBABoJbACdKMysQPd0O0TLGCI9ew0PDYHoauOtjXOltF4AAP7hXpqSEZTyznoZYro7qvhCNXzwD8E2081H/u7pgg3pMmf/eeuRPAABCpHOjKNhvxUOR1hpqGHBjMptXpsMhkejaPwbjtTneL5uf5e/ap9UcNgmmZ767LrG+/+4mep6qiG3gBFWKz4QMj4hSWiVFqDwdnyjEdQGh7D5fNBIMk8S12aJyN+MHu6+TVLrp1Hn6V7ToAYilsUPPjN6xIwUlh92zF5+oOx5Vxb94DcaGL/RvUkKHLUgTDlLhr7ZdY7GmBKHyu6AAA==","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/ni-criterio-ni-criteria/static/ba48419c8108dd7970ba9835fc509f3a/403a4/death_artist.webp","srcSet":"/ni-criterio-ni-criteria/static/ba48419c8108dd7970ba9835fc509f3a/7ca0e/death_artist.webp 250w,\n/ni-criterio-ni-criteria/static/ba48419c8108dd7970ba9835fc509f3a/403a4/death_artist.webp 300w","sizes":"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"}}}}},
